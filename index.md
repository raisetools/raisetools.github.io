RAISE (“Rigorous Approach to Industrial Software Engineering”) is a product consisting of a formal specification language (RSL), an associated method for software development and supporting tools.

RAISE was originally developed during the years 1985-1995 in the CEC-funded projects RAISE (ESPRIT 315) and LaCoS (ESPRIT 5383). The founder of these projects was Dines Bjørner. The original RAISE tool set can be requested from [Jan Storbank Pedersen](mailto:jnp@terma.com) at Terma A/S.

Later extensions to the language and a new tool set, _rsltc_, were developed during the years 1998-2008 at the United Nations University UNU-IIST under the lead of Chris George. At the Technical University of Denmark further extensions to the language and the _rsltc_ tools have been conducted under the lead of Anne Haxthausen. _rsltc_ and some of its extensions, as well as some examples, can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/raisetools?tab=repositories).
